<H3>1.4. Activation scripts</H3>
<P>
Each script can be activated in two ways: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>either using a classic input gesture, 
<LI>either by using the shell of the module. 
</UL>

<P>
In the NVDA "Input gestures" dialog, the scripts provided by the module are placed in the category named "Audacity multi-track editor: accessibility enhancement".
</P>
<P>
For scripts that can be launched by a command interpreter, the command is indicated following the description of the script. 
</P>
<P>
By default, the vast majority of scripts that can be run by the shell are not assigned to any input gesture .
</P>
<P>
The command interpreter is launched using the gesture command "NVDA + Space" . A beep sound is audible. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the commands are not modifiable. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The shell stops is: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>by typing the key "Esc", 
<LI>either automatically if a command is typed. If this commend does not correspond to any feature, a beep signals it. 
</UL>

<A NAME="toc7"></A>
<H2>2. Module's Configuration</H2>
<P>
The module installs in the NVDA's "Preferences" menu,  the "Audacity multi-track editor: accessibility enhancement add-on - settings ..." sub-menu.

</P>
<A NAME="toc15"></A>
<H2>4. Accessibility improvements</H2>
<A NAME="hdr100"></A>
<H3>4.1. Automatic announcement of the audio position</H3>
<P>
In audio playback or not, the following shortcuts from Audacity (set by default) allow you to set or move the cursor audio: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>"Shift + a"or "x": play / stop and positioning of the cursor audio 
<LI>"left arrow": small jump to the left, 
<LI>"right arrow": small jump to the right, 
<LI>"the beginning": jump to the beginning, 
<LI>"end": jump to the end, 
<LI>",": small jump to the left, 
<LI>".": small jump to the right, 
<LI>"Shift + ,": big jump to the left, 
<LI>"Shift + .": big jump to the right, 
<LI>"space": play /stop 
</UL>

<P>
In audio playback stopped and after activation of the shortcut, the field "audio position" of the toolbar "Audacity Selection toolbar" is automatically announced if a change has taken place and in the form: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>announcement of the field's label("audio position", 
<LI>announcement of the contents of the field formatted not to say the zeros. 
</UL>

<P>
The return of the audio position in the beginning of the selection is reported. 
</P>
<P>
These shortcuts can be modified by the user without impacting the operation. 
</P>
<A NAME="hdr101"></A>
<H3>4.2. Automatic Announcement of the selection</H3>
<P>
The following shortcuts from Audacity (set by default) allow you to set or move the start and end of the selection: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>"Shift + home": selection to the start, 
<LI>"Shift + end": selection to the end, 
<LI>"Shift + j": selection of the start of the track up to the slider, 
<LI>"Shift-k": selection from the cursor to the end of the track 
<LI>"Shift + left arrow" to: extend the selection to the left , 
<LI>"Control + Shift + right arrow": to reduce the selection to the right 
<LI>Shift + right arrow": extend the selection to the right, 
<LI>"Control + Shift + left arrow": to reduce the selection to the left 
</UL>

<P>
If the option "Report automaticaly the selection changes" is selected, playback is stopped and after the activation of the shortcut, the selection changes are announced 
Depending on the type of shortcut, one or the other or both of the selection fields of the toolbar in "Selection" are announced in the form: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>announcement of the label of the field, 
<LI>announcement of its contents formatted not to say the zeros. 
</UL>

<P>
As all the labels advertised are those that are displayed by Audacity, there may be inconsistencies due to the translation or at the coding .
</P>
<P>
These shortcuts can be modified by the user without impacting the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The command "f4" shell module allows you to enable or disable the announcement of the selection changes when it becomes annoying. 
It toggles the state of the option "Report automatically the selection changes" to the state "checked" to "unchecked" or vice versa. 
</P>
<A NAME="HDR102"></A>
<H3>4.3. Use the space bar or the Enter key to press a button</H3>
<P>
In Audacity, the bar space is provided to start or stop the audio playback, but not for pressing a button . 
</P>
<P>
To press the button, it is necessary to use the "Enter" key, but this moves the focus to the next item in the window and no status change of the button is vocalized.
</P>
<P>
If the option "Use space bar or Enter key to press a button" is checked, it is then possible to press a button with the space bar or the Enter key and the state changes are announced. 
</P>
<A NAME="HDR103"></A>
<H3>4.4. Vocalization of the edit boxes of the time in the Selection toolbar Audacity</H3>
<P>
The "Audacity Selection" toolbar  shows zones for editing time. 
</P>
<P>
This time is recorded according to a format as you configure the context menu. 
</P>
<P>
To change this time, it is necessary to be placed on the digit to modify (for right or left arrow) and the increase or the decrease with the arrows high or low. 
</P>
<P>
This module allows a better vocalization of a hand indicating the time in hours, minutes and seconds, and on the other hand, in indicating the nature of the digit that is changed: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the tens and the units for the hours, minutes, and seconds, 
<LI>the tenths, hundredths, and thousandths to seconds. 
</UL>

<P>
But only the following format are taken into account: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>seconds,
<LI>HH:MM:SS, 
<LI>dd:hh:mm:ss  ,
<LI>HH:MM:SS,hundredth,
<LI>HH:MM:SS,mil,
<LI>hh:mm:ss + samples  ,
<LI>samples.
</UL>

<P>
The "NVDA + upArrow" key command allows you to vocalize the full-time.
</P>
<P>
The same mechanisms are put in place in other dialog boxes which are areas of editing time in the same style as the  "timer Record" dialog.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr104"></A>
<H3>4.5. Other adapttations</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The tracks are not announced as rows  and the tracks view as a table. 
<LI>The state "not selected" to a track is no longer vocalized. 
<LI>the absence of a track when the focus arrives in the view of the track is announced. 
<LI>The name of the toolbars is announced during the movement of the focus by "control+f6" or "shift+ control+f6" (can be disabled by a configuration option 'Report name of toolbars").
