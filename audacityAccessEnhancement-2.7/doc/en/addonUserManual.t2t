It is possible to disable this update by unchecking the option "automatically check for updates" of "Update" category in the extension settings.
The version of the extension can be:
- a stable version: its version number is "1.0" for example.
- either a development version: the version number is of the type "1.0-dev1", or "1.0-rc1", or "1.0-beta2".


By default, the stable version is updated with a stable version more recent (higher version number).
But it is possible to update the stable version running with a development version of the next stable version. Just check the option "Update also update the stable release to the versions of development" located in the "Update" category of extension settings.

A development version is updated:
- with a more recent development version,
- with its stable version,
- or with the latest stable version if the previous option is not checked.


The button "Search for update" placed in the extension settings, menu item "Update", allows you to search immediately for an update.

In the case of an automatic update and if a new version is detected, the "Update" dialog box is displayed to suggest:
- either the immediate installation of the new version,
- or to postpone the update until later. In this case, the search will be restarted at least one hour later.

++ Compatibility ++
Tis version of add-on has been tested with Audacity version 3.1, 3.0 and 2.4.2. Previous versions of Audacity are not supported.

++ Necessary configuration ++
For proper operation of the module, it is necessary to :
- preserve the default display set up during the installation of audacity, and especially the toolbars. Audacity allows you to reset the display with the sub-menu "Reset" sub-menu "toolbars" from the "View"menu. But it is necessary to restart Audacity after you have used it.
- Keep the display format of the set time by default, or choose from one of the formats listed in chapter [Text edit boxes of the time in the box with the Selection tool Audacity #HDR103]



other configuration recommendations:
- add the menu "Exra" on menus bar,
- disable the creation of labels by simple keystroke,
- enable the option to display of the dialog box "Create label",
-install the complete set of shortcuts,
- disable the auto select option.


++ Activation scripts ++
Each script can be activated in two ways:
- either using a classic input gesture,
- either by using the shell of the module.


In the NVDA "Input gestures" dialog, the scripts provided by the module are placed in the category named "Audacity multi-track editor: accessibility enhancement".

For scripts that can be launched by a command interpreter, the command is indicated following the description of the script.


By default, the vast majority of scripts that can be run by the shell are not assigned to any input gesture .


The command interpreter is launched using the gesture command "KEY_SHELL" . A beep sound is audible.


Today, the commands are not modifiable.

The command "SHELL_KEY_HELP" of the interpreter lists all of the commands and the command "SHELL_KEY_DISPLAY_USER_MANUAL" displays the user manual of the module.

The shell stops is:
- by typing the key "Esc",
- either automatically if a command is typed. If this commend does not correspond to any feature, a beep signals it.


+ Module's Configuration +
The module installs in the NVDA's "Preferences" menu, the "Audacity multi-track editor: accessibility enhancement add-on - settings ..." sub-menu.

It allows you to display the configuration dialog settings of the module, namely:
- the check box "Report automatically the selection changes",
- the check box "use the space bar or the Enter key to press a button",
- the check box "Report toolbars's name".


This configuration is saved in the file "audacityAccessEnhancementAddon.ini" in the NVDA's user configuration folder.

The following scripts make it possible to know the levels of these vu-meters, without moving the focus to the view of the tracks:
- report the level of the play meter peak: "command SHELL_KEY_PLAYMETERPEAK_REPORT" of the interpreter,
- report the level of the record meter peak: command "SHELL_KEY_RECORDMETERPEAK_REPORT"of the interpreter.


By default, no input gesture is assigned.

++ Report the level of the playback and record'sslider ++[hdr5]
The toolbar "Audacity mixer Toolbar" presents the playback and record's sliders allowing you to adjust the levels of playback or recording.

The following scripts make it possible to know the levels of these sliders without moving the focus to the view of the tracks:
- report the level of the playback cursor: command "SHELL_KEY_SLIDERPLAYBACK_REPORT" of the interpreter,
- report the level of the recording cursor: command "SHELL_KEY_SLIDERRECORDING_REPORT" of the interpreter.

It allows you to view the guide of Audacity written by David Bailes for the users of the Jaws (c) screen reader and Audacity v2.2.

+Accessibility improvements +
++ Automatic announcement of the audio position ++[hdr100]
In audio playback or not, the following shortcuts from Audacity (set by default) allow you to set or move the cursor audio:
- "Shift + a" or "x": play / stop and positioning of the cursor audio
- "left arrow": small jump to the left,
- "right arrow": small jump to the right,
- "the beginning": jump to the beginning,
- "end": jump to the end,
- ",": small jump to the left,
- ".": small jump to the right,
- "Shift + ,": big jump to the left,
- "Shift + .": big jump to the right,
- "space": play /stop


In audio playback stopped and after activation of the shortcut, the field "audio position" of the toolbar "Audacity Selection toolbar" is automatically announced if a change has taken place and in the form:
- announcement of the field's label("audio position",
- announcement of the contents of the field formatted not to say the zeros.


The return of the audio position in the beginning of the selection is reported.

These shortcuts can be modified by the user without impacting the operation.


++ Automatic Announcement of the selection ++[hdr101]
The following shortcuts from Audacity (set by default) allow you to set or move the start and end of the selection:
- "Shift + home": selection to the start,
- "Shift + end": selection to the end,
- "Shift + j": selection of the start of the track up to the slider,
- "Shift-k": selection from the cursor to the end of the track,
- Shift + right arrow": to extend the selection to the right,
- "Shift + left arrow": to extend the selection to the left,
- "Control + Shift + right arrow": to contract the selection to the left,
- "Control + Shift + left arrow": to contract the selection to the right.


If the option "Report automaticaly the selection changes" located in "Options" category of the extension settings is selected, playback is stopped and after the activation of the shortcut, the selection changes are announced
Depending on the type of shortcut, one or the other or both of the selection fields of the toolbar in "Selection" are announced in the form:
- announcement of the label of the field,
- announcement of its contents formatted not to say the zeros.


As all the labels advertised are those that are displayed by Audacity, there may be inconsistencies due to the translation or at the coding .

These shortcuts can be modified by the user without impacting the operation.

The command "SHELL_KEY_TOGGLE_AUTOMATIC_SELECTION_REPORT" shell module allows you to enable or disable the announcement of the selection changes when it becomes annoying.
It toggles the state of the option "Report automatically the selection changes" to the state "checked" to "unchecked" or vice versa.

++ Use the space bar or the Enter key to press a button ++[HDR102]
In Audacity, the bar space is provided to start or stop the audio playback, but not for pressing a button .

To press the button, it is necessary to use the "Enter" key, but this moves the focus to the next item in the window and no status change of the button is vocalized.

If the option "Use space bar or Enter key to press a button" located in "Options" category of extension settings is checked, it is then possible to press a button with the space bar or the Enter key and the state changes are announced.


++ Vocalization of the time's edit spin boxes ++[HDR103]
Audacity shows some edit spin boxes for editing time like, for exemple: audio position, selection start, selection end, selection center, selection length .

This time is recorded according to a format as you configure the context menu.

To change this time, it is necessary to be placed on the digit to modify (for right or left arrow) and the increase or the decrease with the arrows high or low.

By default, this module allows a better vocalization of a hand indicating the time in hours, minutes and seconds, and on the other hand, in indicating the nature of the digit that is changed:
- the tens and the units for the hours, minutes, and seconds,
- the tenths, hundredths, and thousandths to seconds.


This feature can be desactivated by unchecking the "Edit spin box enhanced announcement" check box located in "Options" category of extension settings.

But only the following format are taken into account:

- seconds,
- HH:MM:SS,
- dd:hh:mm:ss,
- HH:MM:SS,hundredth,
- HH:MM:SS,mil,
- hh:mm:ss + samples,
- samples.


The "NVDA + upArrow" key command allows you to vocalize the full-time.

The same mechanisms are put in place in other edit spin boxes which are areas of editing time in the same style as the "timer Record" dialog.

++ Other adapttations ++[hdr104]
- The tracks are not announced as rows and the tracks view as a table.
- The state "not selected" to a track is no longer vocalized.
- the absence of a track when the focus arrives in the view of the track is announced.
- The name of the toolbars is announced during the movement of the focus by "control+f6" or "shift+ control+f6" (can be disabled by a configuration option 'Report name of toolbars").
