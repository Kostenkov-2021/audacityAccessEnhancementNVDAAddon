</P>
<P>

</P>
<UL>
<LI>with a more recent development version,
<LI>with its stable version,
<LI>or with the latest stable version if the previous option is not checked.
</UL>

<A NAME="hdr100"></A>
<H3>4.1. Automatic announcement of the audio position</H3>
<P>

</P>
<A NAME="HDR103"></A>

<P>
This time is recorded according to a format as you configure the context menu.
</P>
<P>
To change this time, it is necessary to be placed on the digit to modify (for right or left arrow) and the increase or the decrease with the arrows high or low.
</P>
<P>

<LI>dd:hh:mm:ss,
<LI>HH:MM:SS,hundredth,
